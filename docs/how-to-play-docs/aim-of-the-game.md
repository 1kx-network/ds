# Aim of The Game

Although access to this early version of *****Downstream***** is primarily to see what creators can (or can’t) do with our game, we have created a simple quest to get the party started

## The "Ultimate Goal" Building

Just north of the Spawn point is a building that requires two items. It will reward a medal to whomever can bring it those items.

## Starting the Quest

There some other buildings near the Spawn point. We suggest you craft the items you can get here. Not only are they required for a later part of the quest, but will improve your stats enough to start defeating the easiest enemies.

## Go Explore!

Go visit the buildings on the map, fight enemies and construct you own buildings. By exploring the world, crafting items, and winning at combat you should be able to construct the items needed to “win” the game.
