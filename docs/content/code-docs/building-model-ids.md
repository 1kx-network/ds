# Building Model IDs

Building visuals are constructed using two stacked 'totems'.
You can choose which totems to use for your building by setting the `model` tag in your buildings manifest.

The format for setting the model tag is as follows: `model: ID-ID` where the first 'ID' is the **lower** building in the stack and the second is the **upper** building.

For example, `model: 01-08` would create a building with a Bird Totem on the bottom and a Wooden Hut on the top.

**Here is a list of all available totem IDs for you to choose from:**
